# JavaScript Password Generator

## An 8-128 alphanumeric (including special characters) password generator

In an effort to better understand JavaScript's functionality, the software developer has refined the existing code related to the given password generator. For the user, the new pasword generator will provide a randomly generated password based on a few selections of input from the user, negating the need to come up with complicated passwords on one's own.

For the developer, some discoveries were made whilst making this code funtional, including:

 -NaN option used to force user to choose an actual number in regards to number of characters in password string.

 -discovered a probability irregularity that resulted in the user getting more characters than desired (see notes on js for fix)

 -addressed the issue of missing character selections in user's password, effectively forcing the program to guarantee a character from each of the user's selections
able of Contents (Optional)

## Usage

Upon launching the site, user will be prompted with a series of questions to determine the parameters of their password. User will be redirected to the start of the program if their answers are invalid.

Users must choose the number of characters desired in their password (between 8 and 128 characters), and then must chose at least ONE option as to which characters they would like to include as options.

Upon completion of the pop-up questionnaire, the user will be given a randomly generated password based upon their criteria.
